# AWS IoT AND AMAZON KINESIS PROJECTS

Projects using AWS Services including AWS IoT (Internet of Things),
Amazon Kinesis, and so on

## SMART HOME SECURITY AND AUTOMATION

Smart home and automation is an internet of things solution for users to have
more control from preventing water leaks to air quality. It brings reliability
and intelligence to homes using AWS IoT services, applications and sensors.
Also, provides insurance and voice controlled features using Alexa Voice Services
and other AI services.

## AIR QUALITY MONITORING IN SMART CITY USING WIRELESS SENSORS

In addition to discussions around reducing traffic congestion, easier access
to parking, monitoring and control of water quality, monitoring of air quality
is also a key element of a smart city which is also aimed at reducing levels
of greenhouse gases and combating global warming.


## REMOTE FUEL MONITORING

For diesel generators, fuel tanks, trucks and heavy machinery, the remote
fuel monitoring solution is a more accurate way to prevent losses, improve
operations cost and efficiency.

# FLEET MONITORING SOLUTIONS / TRUCKING IoT

Fleet monitoring solution helps to provide insights from data collected from
electronic logging devices (ELDs) in cars and trucks and track drive times,
location, temperature, engine temperature, speed, and so on. Data is enriched
with weather data and other data in the device and in the AWS cloud.

## Outline

-   [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
-   [Quick, How Do I Use It?!](#quick-how-do-i-use-it)
-   [How It Works](#how-it-works)

## Prerequisites

-   An instance of the code is added to a directory on the Raspberry Pi.
-   Recent releases of Node and NPM packages are installed in the directory.
-   Get private key, private certificate and root certificate obtained by creating a representation of the device
-   in the AWS IoT management console or using AWS CLI

## Quick, How Do I Use It?!

In the directory for the sub-project, navigate the [Fleet Monitoring or Trucking IoT sub-directory] of this project (https://github.com/mmaro/aws-iot-projects/tree/master/fleetMonitoring) and then to truck js in the truckDataLogging folder and execute the command below:

```
node truck.js
```

## How it Works
